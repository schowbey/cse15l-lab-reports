# Lab Report 1: Remotely Connecting
### January 16, 2023

For this lab, we are remotely connecting to a course-specific account. After setting the password for that account, I followed these steps.

1. **Opening VScode.**

    I already had VScode installed, so this is what it looked like when I opened it.

2. **Windows Extra Steps**
    
    Then, I had to change the terminal in VS code to match one of Linux or IOS. I did this by downloading Git Bash.

    Then, I used the command palette to change the terminal, as shown below.

3. **Remotely Connecting**

    After I changed my terminal, I was able to use the *ssh* command to log into my course-specific account.

    The command was *ssh cs15lwi23avf@ieng6.ucsd.edu*

    I was prompted to enter the password I created earlier. Then, I successfully logged in.

4. **Extra Commands**

    I played with some of the commands provided, such as *cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt*.

    This command read the contents of the text file hello.txt and printed them onto the console.
